A simple GUI for the PDF merging abilities of the package [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2) using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

> Disclaimer: I made this program for personal use because I do not want to upload files to any of the countless websites that provide the same functionality. The capabilities are still very low but I might update this project sometime in the future.

# Requirements

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org)
2. Install the Package [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2) using the following command:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

3. Download the [python file](https://github.com/Falyrion/PDF-Merge/blob/main/pdf_merge/merge_pdf.py) from this project

# How to use

To run the program execute the following command (in the directory, the python file is stored):

```bash
python merge_pdf.py
```

PDF files you select will be merged in alphabetical order. The output will be saved in the directory you start the program in.
